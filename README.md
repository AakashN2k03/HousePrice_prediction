# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.
The prediction is done using a linear regression model trained on a dataset containing historical house prices and their corresponding features.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage of living area, and location details like latitude and longitude.
The target variable is the price of the house.
